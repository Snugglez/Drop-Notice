# Drop-Notice
Sends a message in [Proxy] chat when ever a specific item drops

Originally designed to see if anything worth dropped from world bams, but could be used in other places like ghillie so you won't get baited by that otherworldly shard drop :^)

`!dropnotice` or just `dropnotice` if used on /8 or /proxy chat channel to toggle it on or off

Currently supported items are [Diamond, Pansophic Ash, Elemental Essence, Superior Etching box, Otherworldly Shard, Stormcry Equipment Chest, Frostmetal Equipment Chest]

p.s.... requires command module, shouldn't need to link that should I?
